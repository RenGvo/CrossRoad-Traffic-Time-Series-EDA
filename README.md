# Crossroad Traffic Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis

Crossroad traffic datasets contains data of detector occupancy, traffic volume and average speed during the year by hour.
The following performances has been done in this time series data:

- Data Exploration
- Time Series Analysis: Trends and Seasonality
      <ul>
        <li>Trend - a general systematic linear or (most often) nonlinear component that changes over time and does not repeat</li>
        <li>Seasonality - a general systematic linear or (most often) nonlinear component that changes over time and does repeat</li>
      </ul>
- Aggregating Components: trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Resampling (changing the frequency of your time series observations)
      <ul>
        <li>summary by week</li>
        <li>summary by weekday</li>
        <li>summary by hour</li>
        <li>summary by hour on Weekend and Workdays</li>
      </ul>
- The ARIMA Time Series Model
      <ul>
        <li>Parameter Selection for the ARIMA (SARIMAX, AIC method)</li>
        <li>Fitting an ARIMA Time Series Model</li>
        <li>Validating Forecasts (static and dynamic forecasts, MSE, R2 score)</li>
        <li>Producing and Visualizing Forecasts</li>
      </ul>

Jupyter Notebook for Python 3 was used to permorm analysis.
